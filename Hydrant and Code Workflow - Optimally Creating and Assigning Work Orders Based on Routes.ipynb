Let's assume that there are around 25 breweries that need to be inspected and that there are 5 workers that are available to do the inspections. As the supervisor of these workers I'm going to develop a Python Script (well, Jupyter Notebook in this case) that will optimally create distinct routes for my workers, create assignments at the hydrant locations, and then assign the assignment to the correct worker."
